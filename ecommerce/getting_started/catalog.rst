Highlight a product
===================

Boost the visibility of your star (or promoted) products in a number of different ways. Push them
to top, make them bigger, add an editable ribbon to attract attention (*Sale*, *New*, etc.).

Simply open the *Shop* page, switch to *Edit* mode, and click any item to start customizing.

.. tip::
   See how to do it `here <https://www.odoo.com/openerp_website/static/src/video/e-commerce/editing

   (**NOTE**: *Footage is from Odoo v13, but the methodology still applies.*)

Quick 'Add to Cart'
===================

If customers tend to buy a lot of items at once, you can make their shopping experience even
*faster* by enabling an "Add to Cart" button directly on products found on your catalog page.

To do this, you'll want to activate the *Add to Cart* feature, located under the *Customize*
drop-down menu on the header.

You may want to add a product description, as well. That way, customers can quickly see a brief
description of the product and add it to their virtual cart in just one click. To do that, make
sure to activate the *Product Description* feature in the *Customize* menu.

Both features appear in Grid and List view.

-  **Grid** view (appears when cursor hovers over product):
