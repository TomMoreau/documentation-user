Scoring surveys
===============

To measure your participant’s performance, knowledge of a subject, or overall satisfaction,
you can attach points to the answers of specific questions. The points are summed up to give your
participant a final score.

On your survey’s form, click on *Add a question* and (under the *Options* tab) you can choose
between *Scoring with answers at the end* or *Scoring without answers at the end*. Then, on your
question’s form, you can set the right answer and score.

Set the percentage score that the user will need to achieve in order to have successfully taken the
survey. If enabling *Certificate*, choose its template. The certification is automatically sent
by email to the users who successfully finish it.
