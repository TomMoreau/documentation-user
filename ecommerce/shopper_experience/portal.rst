Access customer account
=======================

It has never been easier for customers to access their
customer account. Forget endless signup forms, 
Odoo makes it as easy as 1-2-3.
They are suggested to sign up (name, email, password) when an order
is placed, and not before.

Sign up
=======

The invitation to sign up appears when the customer wants to visualize
the order from the order confirmation email.

Customer account
================

Once logged in, the customer will access the account by clicking *My Account*
in the login dropdown menu.

There, they will find all their history. The main address (billing) can also be modified.

.. note::
    If the customer is set as a contact of a company in your address book,
    they will see all their pertinent documents related to that company.
